# Messages
The way the messages work are the following, every tile will be a string as the following:
XXY: where XX is the number, always with two digits (01, 02, etc.) and Y the colour(Y yellow, R red, B blue, D black, W wildcard) 

Every message will be transmitted with a letter first being where the tiles are going:
H the hand, T the table

The bag will be only part of the host

Tiles will be separated from eachother by a - symbol
